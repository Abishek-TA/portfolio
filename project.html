                    <h3>Handwritten Text Recognition</h3>
                    <p>Tamil is a Dravidian language spoken predominantly by Tamil in India and is a popular South Indian Language. This abstract explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Tamil text recognition. By automatically extracting features and learning hierarchical representations, CNN-based OCR systems demonstrate efficiency in handling diverse handwriting styles and script complexities. Integration with preprocessing techniques and strategies like data augmentation enhances their performance. The existing methods have issues related to adaptability, data bias, generalization, complexity, and performance gaps. A dataset of Tamil texts is necessary, and the image database for text recognition is described. The recognition model is sophisticated, demonstrating high precision and accuracy in categorizing Tamil texts. Performance evaluations will be conducted on a dedicated test set where input text is provided.  The dataset of Tamil text contributes to the advancement of text recognition. The outcome is to identify the handwritten Tamil text in a specific domain.</p>
